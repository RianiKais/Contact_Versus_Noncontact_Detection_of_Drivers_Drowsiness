# Contact_Versus_Noncontact_Detection_of_Drivers_Drowsiness
Abstract—With an estimated number of injuries in the millions, accidents caused due to drowsy driving remain a significant
source of financial costs and loss of life. Accurate detection of driver’s drowsiness could provide a clear avenue towards
eliminating a great majority of the associated accidents and losses. Existing research on the subject could be defined as
either contact-based or noncontact-based alertness detection. This paper utilizes a novel multimodal driver’s alertness dataset
consisting of 45 subjects via seven recorded channels, including four contact-based and three noncontact-based channels, to investigate
the performance of said modalities in detecting driver’s drowsiness as well as provide a novel comparison between the
results of multiple contact and noncontact methods. Our results highlight the viability of noncontact methods to detect driver’s drowsiness as an implementable technology in automobiles.
